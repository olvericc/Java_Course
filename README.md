# Java_Course

this repository aims to document all my progress in relation to the studies of the java programming language, through the course on the udemy platform, where I study and practice everything about this language.
I chose it because of the familiarity I feel, because it was the first language I studied during my technical course on systems analysis and development, it was with it that I learned the basic structures and paradigms of object-oriented programming.
